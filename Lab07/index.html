            <div>
                <p>Hi! I'm Danielle. My whole life, I've loved photography. What fascinates me the most, is the ability to capture a moment and freeze it in time. I decided to pursue my passion for photography in college. The knowledge I gained about the technique and art of photography truly propelled my interest to new heights. Photography has greatly impacted and changed our world. I look forward to adding my work to this revolutionary collection.</p>
                <p>My love behind the lens comes forth in my photography. To me, "Photography is life's elegance preserved in the most beautiful format."</p>
